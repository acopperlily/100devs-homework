// An ordered sequence of numbers from 1 to N is given. One number might have deleted from it, then the remaining numbers were mixed. Find the number that was deleted.

// Example:

// The starting array sequence is [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
// The mixed array with one deleted number is [3,2,4,6,7,8,1,9]
// Your function should return the int 5.
// If no number was deleted from the starting array, your function should return the int 0.

// Note: N may be 1 or less (in the latter case, the first array will be []).

function findDeletedNumber(arr, mixArr) {
  const len = arr.length;
  const sum = len / 2 * (len + 1);
  return mixArr.reduce((acc, c) => acc - c, sum);
